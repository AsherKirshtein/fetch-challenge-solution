# 🧾 Fetch Challenge Solution

Here is my solution to the Fetch Receipt Processor Challenge.

---

## 🚀 Docker Setup

### **1️⃣ Build the Docker Container**
Run the following command to **build** and **run** the Docker image:
```sh
docker build -t receipt-processor .
docker run -p 8000:8000 receipt-processor

```

I included my own test in there as well, I also used Postman to test as well
as curl commands. I really enjoyed the challenge and I look forward to getting more!
